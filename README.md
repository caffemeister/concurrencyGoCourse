This repo contains code for a Go concurrent programming course, which I used to learn about:
* goroutines
* channels
* waitgroups
* mutexes
* basics of `Docker`
* basics of `Make`
* basics of `HTTP stuff` like Handlers, Requests, and routing in Go
* tiny bit of `postgres`
* tiny bit of `redis`
* and my new favourite SQL db editor -> `Beekeeper Studio`
